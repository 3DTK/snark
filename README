generic c++ libraries and utilities for robotics

INSTALLATION

Currently only building from source using CMake is available. (After building
from source, you can generate deb package using CPack, though.)

Quickest way:

> mkdir ~/src
> cd ~/src
> git clone https://gitlab.com/orthographic/snark.git
> ansible-playbook snark/system/ansible/install.yml --ask-become-pass

Read install.yml, if interested in tweaking build configuration or building manually

You could build a docker image (which will run ansible install.yml):

> docker build snark/system/docker -t snark.ubuntu-18.04.image

Not all snark components are turned install.yml, since you probably will not need them all.

If you want to turn on/off various bits of snark, use snark/system/ansible/install.yml and snark/system/docker/Dockerfile to create your own playbook and docker image.
