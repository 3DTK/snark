ensure that control-error attempts to use the most current feedback for computing the errors

- publish feedback frequently and continuously
- wait for a second
- send a waypoint
- wait for the waypoint to be reached
- wait for a short while and then send another waypoint
- wait for the second waypoint to be reached
- observe that the latest feedback is used at the moment of receiving each waypoint
