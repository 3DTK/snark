ensure that control-error attempts to use the most current feedback for computing the errors

- send several feedback points ( seed data/feedback.csv with fields t,x,y,yaw)
- wait for a while
- send a waypoint ( see data/waypoints.csv with fields x,y,heading_offset)
- get output errors
- observe that the last feedback point is used for the errors
