dynamic mode 

- publish feedback using csv-play ( see data/readme and data/feedback.csv )
- sleep for a while to synchronise feedback and target streams
- send target waypoints to control-error (timed with csv-play)
- add time_diff to output (current feedback time minus the start time); to use in expected
- determine the indexes that correspond to reached=1 output; to use in expected

the trajectory describes a square with target waypoints at the corners

- the first target is at 200,0
- the second target 100,100 is sent at t=1 when the trajectory is at 100,0
- the 3rd target is at -100,100
- the forth target 0,0 is sent at t=3 when the trajectory is at 0,100
