# Two waypoints are fed to the control with indexes 0 and 1 (and different speeds).
# The feedback is at the rate of 10 per second, however some of the early feedback values could be missed by the control.
# Hence the number of output commands may vary but it cannot be greater than 21, which is when the second target waypoint is reached (see data/feedback.csv).
