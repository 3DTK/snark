# Two waypoints are fed to the control with indexes 0 and 1 (and different speeds).
# The feedback is at the rate of 10 per second, however some of the early feedback values could be missed by the control.
# Hence the number of output commands may vary but it cannot be greater than 21, which is when the second target waypoint is reached (see data/feedback.csv).

number_of( output/commands) <= 21

output/commands[0]/speed=11.1
output/commands[0]/index=0

output/commands[MAX]/speed=22.2

# Since yaw is changing (see data/feedback.csv), turn_rate and local heading will be changing as well.
output/commands[0]/turn_rate <> output/commands[MAX]/turn_rate
